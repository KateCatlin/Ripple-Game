## About

Most trivia games test static knowledge—*"What year did X happen?"*

Ripple is different. It tests **causal reasoning**. 

You're shown a real historical event and asked to predict what happened next. Get it right, and you follow the chain deeper—3 events total, each consequence leading to the next. 

```
Ripple #728 🌊
Event 1: ✅
Event 2: ❌
Event 3: ✅
Chain Score: 2/3
```

It's not about memorizing dates.  It's about understanding how decisions ripple through history—how consumers react, how companies pivot, how one invention enables another.

**New puzzle every day.  Same puzzle for everyone.**

## Puzzle Content Guidelines

Good Ripple chains should: 

- ✅ Be historically accurate and verifiable
- ✅ Have surprising but logical cause-and-effect connections
- ✅ Include plausible wrong answers (not obviously fake)
- ✅ Teach something interesting even when you guess wrong
- ✅ Span 3-4 events in the chain
